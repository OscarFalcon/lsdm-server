# lsdm-server

To start the application use:

npm install
sudo AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<SECRET_KEY> AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=>ACCESS_ID> node app.js

The access key and access id are ommited since they provice access to AWS S3 resources.

This is a nodejs project and thus requires the nodejs and npm packages be installed.
